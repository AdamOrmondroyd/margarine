================================================================
PackageName: Posterior Sampling and Marginal Bayesian Statistics
================================================================

To Do:
-----

- Need a catchy PackageName (preferably not nestedflows so that we can
  make the distinction between the two packages)
- Need to double check who gets credited as an author since we are
  recycling some of the nestedflows code
- Should write up example code into jupyter notebook for hosting on binder.

The current example can be run by cloning the git repo and following the
instructions below

.. code:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:htjb/bayesstats.git
  cd bayesstats
  python3 basic_example.py

The code should be well documented and is currently only intended as an
example of functionality/application for collaborators. The code is still
being edited and the example will be kept as up to date as possible.
